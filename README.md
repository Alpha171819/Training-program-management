# Training Program Management

This repository contains a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app for the Training Program Management application.

# Project Description

The Training Program Management project is a web-based application designed to assist the course control officers at MCEME in managing training programs and generating weekly timetables. The application allows the course control officers to input course details, instructor information, subjects, class rooms, and topics. Based on this input, the application dynamically generates a weekly program or timetable for the upcoming week.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Configuration Required
Create a .env.local file with NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3131
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL should point to the server URL where the backend is running.
